# Expression-Calculator
Symbolic Calculator using a RPN algorithm to parse and calculate values including symbols such as RT for root and LN for natural log.

This was my final project for COP3503 Programming Fundementals 2 (C++) in which we made a fully functioning expression calculator on the 
command line that would allow you to simplify and calculate values. It uses the Reverse Polish Notation algorithm to convert an expression
into infix and uses logic to calculate the value of the expression. It supports symbols including root, log, and has values for pi and e 
hardcoded into the logic.
